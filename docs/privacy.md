# Privacy Policy for Salesforce Developer GPT

This GPT connects to Salesforce via OAuth 2.0 using external Actions to fulfill user requests such as querying metadata and running Apex code.

## What We Collect
This GPT does not collect, store, or share any personal information, tokens, or Salesforce data.

## How Authentication Works
Users authenticate with **their own Salesforce Connected App** credentials. Authentication is handled securely by OpenAIâ€™s platform using OAuth 2.0. Access tokens are not visible to the GPT or its developer.

## How Data Is Used
All data retrieved from Salesforce (e.g., object metadata, SOQL results) is used **only to fulfill user requests** during the session and is not stored or logged.

## Revoking Access
Users may revoke GPT access to their Salesforce org at any time by:
- Going to "Connected Apps OAuth Usage" in their Salesforce org
- Revoking the token for the relevant connected app
